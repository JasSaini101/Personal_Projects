### 📝 Preface
A chess knight is unique in the way it moves as it jumps multiple squares (2 in one direction and 1 in another perpendicular direction) to form an "L-Shaped Move." A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. 

### 🔍 Algorithms
There are multiple approaches to solve the knight's tour, the most efficient being Warnsdorff's Algorithm, in which the knight is instructed to go to the square with the least amount of qualifying neighbors. The least efficient approach is a simple brute force method.

### 💻 My Code
I built both programs to compare the efficiency between these two approaches to see how much of a difference the algorithm really makes.

Just pick your algorithm, input the board size, and the starting square for the knight. Just beware, not all boards have solutions; all arguments for the functions affect whether or not the board is solvable.
